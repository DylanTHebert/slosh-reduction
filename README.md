# slosh-reduction

Results and analysis of slosh reduction on a 6dof robotic manipulator through the use of input masking. Computer vision was used to track the movement of the projected suface of the water through time. Two examples of fluid motion are shown below, one with no control theory applied and the second with input shaping. Input shaping clearly significantly reduced the fluid motion.
